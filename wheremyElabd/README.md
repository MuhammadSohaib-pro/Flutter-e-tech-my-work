where my items project.

## Getting Started
Description :

Hello, I want to create an iPhone app called " Where's my? "
The app is meant to help people find items at home.

It should be able to do 3 simple things:
On the homepage you can use the scroll down menu to select an item and it will reveal the location/place you left this item.

On a 'add storage place' page you should be able to add a storage place ('the kitchen drawer' for example)

On a 'add item' page you should be able to add an item and store it in one of your storage places (for example store 'iPhone charging cable' in the 'kitchen drawer')

The app should have 5-6 pages A login/register page, A homepage where you can select the item you are looking for, A page to add a storage place in your house,
A page to add an item to a storage place and a settings page

Thanks in advance.
